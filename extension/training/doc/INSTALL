Installation
============
Required content
----------------
Create a folder at the root of the content tree. This folder will serve as the main container for all "Classified Ad" objects. This can be done through the administration interface, or using the front-end editing feature (website toolbar).

Let us create a few "Classified Ad" objects under this folder. Here is how the tree structure would look after having created two classifieds :

:: 

 Home [Frontpage]
 `-- Classifieds [Folder]
     |-- Aston Martin 1962 AC Cobra [Classified Ad]
     `-- Ford Mustang 1967 [Classified Ad]
  
Let us then enrich this content by adding a Gallery object right under a Classified Ad. This Gallery will contain Image objects. 
Here is how the content structure looks, after having added a Gallery, and images (using the Multiupload feature) under it : 

:: 

 Home [Frontpage]
 `-- Classifieds [Folder]
     |-- Aston Martin 1962 AC Cobra [Classified Ad]
     |   `-- Gallery [Gallery]
     |       |-- Aston Martin Cobra 1962 - image 1 [Image]
     |       |-- Aston Martin Cobra 1962 - image 2 [Image]
     |       |-- Aston Martin Cobra 1962 - image 3 [Image]
     |       `-- Aston Martin Cobra 1962 - image 4 [Image]
     `-- Ford Mustang 1967 [Classified Ad]
 

Design fallback configuration
-----------------------------
Let us alter the configuration of the siteaccess called 'eng'. 

**WARNING** :

::
  
 If 'eng' is not existing on your installation, pick the siteacces used for front-end access. This means you will have to rename the <ez-publish-root>/extension/training/settings/siteaccess/eng folder.
 Example : if the front-end siteaccess is called 'ezflow_site', the instructions below will apply to this siteaccess, and you will have to rename <ez-publish-root>/extension/training/settings/siteaccess/eng to <ez-publish-root>/extension/training/settings/siteaccess/ezflow_site.


Transform the [DesignSettings] block content from :

:: 

 [DesignSettings]
 SiteDesign=ezflow
 AdditionalSiteDesignList[]
 AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=ezwebin
 AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=base
 AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=standard


to :

:: 

 [DesignSettings]
 SiteDesign=training
 AdditionalSiteDesignList[]
 AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=ezflow
 AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=ezwebin
 AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=base
 AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=standard 

As a result, the custom design brought in the 'training' extension will be used as the main one, for your siteaccess. The other designs remain in the base of the design fallback/stack.
 

Extension activation + autoloads
--------------------------------
Place this extension in the ``extension`` folder of eZ Publish, then navigate to Administration Interface > Setup > Extensions, check the box in front of 'training' in the extension list, and hit the "Apply" button.
This not only activates the extension, but also regenerates the autoload files.


Updating the override rule with the classified ads container nodeID
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The folder containing all Classified Ads needs to be displayed in a more fancy way then the default way. An override rule, and associated template were created. Open ``<ez-publish-root>/extension/training/settings/siteaccess/eng/override.ini.append.php``, and check the first configuration block :  

:: 

 [classified_ad_repository_full]
 Source=node/view/full.tpl
 MatchFile=full/classified_ad_repository.tpl
 Subdir=templates
 Match[node]=163

Due to the dynamic nature of node IDs, the Classified Ads container on your installation might not be the same as on mine. Make sure the node ID value, on the last line, matches the actual node ID of your Classified Ads container. The node ID can be found when viewing the concerned Folder in eZ Publish Administration Interface.


Clearing the caches
-------------------
Clear all caches for changes to apply. You can do so from the Administration Interface, hit the "Content Structure" top-level tab, open the right-hand side toolbox (click the double-arrow), and hit the "Clear" button under "Clear cache". 


Testing
------- 
From the front-end sitaccess, navigate to the folder containing Classified Ads. It should show a map on which the Classified Ads you created are plotted. Opening the bubble for one of them and clicking the link should lead you to its full view, listing the content, the image gallery if any, and a map.
Enjoy :)
